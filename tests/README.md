## Implementation Notes

### Test Design Principles
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent and doesn't affect others
- **Mocking**: External dependencies are mocked for reliable testing
- **Coverage**: All critical paths and error scenarios are tested
- **Performance**: Tests validate system behavior under load
- **Accessibility**: Tests ensure proper DOM structure and ARIA support

### Mock Strategy
- Chrome extension APIs are mocked to avoid browser dependencies
- Storage APIs use in-memory implementations for test isolation
- DOM manipulation is tested with real jsdom environment
- Performance APIs are mocked with consistent timing

### Error Simulation
- Network failures through fetch mocking
- Storage quota exceeded scenarios
- DOM element removal for missing view tests
- Invalid data formats for parsing errors
